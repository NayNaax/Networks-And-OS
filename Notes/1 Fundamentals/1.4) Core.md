# Network Core: Packet/Circuit Switching
## Network Core Overview
* **Interconnected Routers:** Mesh of forwarding devices.
* **Packet Forwarding:** Routing data from source to destination.
## Packet Switching
* **Packetization:** Messages broken into packets.
* **Forwarding:** Packets routed across links.
* **Full Link Capacity:** Each packet uses the entire link.
* **Store-and-Forward:** Complete packet arrival before forwarding.
* **Transmission Delay (L/R):** Time to send a packet.
* **End-End Delay:** Total time for packet delivery.
## Packet Queueing and Loss
* **Queueing:** Packets waiting for transmission.
* **Packet Loss:** Dropped packets due to buffer overflow.
## Key Network-Core Functions
* **Forwarding:** Local packet movement.
* **Routing:** Global path determination.
## Circuit Switching
* **Dedicated Resources:** Allocated for each call.
* **No Sharing:** Resources exclusively used.
* **Idle Segments:** Unused resources
