## Operating System Definition
An Operating System (OS):
*   **Exploits the hardware resources of one or more processors**.
*   **Provides a set of services to system users**.
*   **Manages secondary memory and I/O devices**.

## Basic Elements of a Computer System
*   **Processor (Central Processing Unit - CPU)**: Controls computer operation and performs data processing.
*   **Main Memory**: Stores data and programs.  Volatile (real memory/primary memory).
*   **I/O Modules**: Move data between the computer and the external environment (secondary memory, communications, terminals).
*   **System Bus**: Provides communication among processors, main memory, and I/O modules. (Registers involved: PC, IR, MAR, MBR, I/O AR, I/O BR).
