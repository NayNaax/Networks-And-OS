# I/O Techniques

## Three Techniques for I/O Operations
*   **Programmed I/O**
*   **Interrupt-Driven I/O**
*   **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**

## Programmed I/O
*   Processor issues I/O command.
*   I/O module performs action, sets status bits.
*   **Processor periodically checks status.**
*   **Inefficient**: Processor wastes time waiting.

## Interrupt-Driven I/O
*   Processor issues I/O command, continues other work.
*   I/O module interrupts when ready.
*   Processor handles data transfer, resumes previous work.
*   More efficient than programmed I/O, but still requires processor intervention for each transfer.

## Direct Memory Access (DMA)
*   Processor issues command to DMA module:
    *   Read/Write
    *   I/O device address
    *   Memory start location
    *   Number of words
*   **DMA module transfers data directly to/from memory without processor involvement.**
*   Processor only involved at start and end.
*   **Most efficient**: Processor free for other tasks during transfer.
# Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP)

## Characteristics of SMP
*   **Two or more similar processors** (comparable capability).
*   **Shared main memory**.
*   **Shared I/O devices**.
*   **Processors perform same functions**.
*   **Controlled by an integrated operating system**.

## Advantages of SMP
*   **Performance**: Increased performance through parallelism.
*   **Availability**: Failure of one processor doesn't halt the system.
*   **Incremental Growth**: Add processors for more performance.
*   **Scaling**: Vendors offer different price/performance options.
# Multicore Computers

## Definition of Multicore Systems
*   **Combines two or more processors (cores) on a single chip (die)**.  Also known as a chip multiprocessor.

## Core Components and Cache Levels
*   Each core is a full processor.
*   Typically includes shared L2 and sometimes L3 cache.
