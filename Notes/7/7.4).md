# Operating System Fundamentals

## Definition and Role of an Operating System
*   **Program that controls execution of application programs.**
*   **Interface between applications and hardware.**

## Main Objectives of an OS
*   **Convenience**: Easy to use.
*   **Efficiency**: Efficient resource management.
*   **Ability to Evolve**: Permits development/testing/introduction of new functions.

## OS and Hardware/Software Interaction
*   Interacts with hardware and software.
*   Provides **Application Programming Interface (API)**.
*   Manages **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**.

## Operating System Services
*   **Program development** (editors, compilers).
*   **Program execution**.
*   **Access I/O devices**.
*   **Controlled access to files**.
*   **System access** (security).
*   **Error detection and response**.
*   **Accounting**.
*   **Memory Management.**
# Evolution of Operating Systems

## Reasons for OS Evolution
*   **Hardware upgrades**.
*   **New types of hardware**.
*   **New services**.
*   **Fixes**.

## Stages of OS Evolution
*   **Serial Processing**: Direct user access, one program at a time.
*   **Simple Batch Systems**: Monitor program manages batch of jobs.
*   **Multiprogrammed Batch Systems**: Multiple programs in memory concurrently (improves utilization).
*   **Time Sharing Systems**: Interactive computing, multiple users.

# Major Achievements in OS Development

## Processes
*   Fundamental concept.
*   Definitions:
    *   **Program in execution**.
    *   **Instance of a running program**.
    *   **Entity assigned to and executed on a processor**.
    *   **Unit of activity with a thread, state, and resources**.

## Memory Management
*   **Virtual memory**: Logical addressing, regardless of physical memory.
*   **Paging**: Processes divided into fixed-size pages; dynamic mapping.

## Information Protection and Security
*   Controlling access to system and information.
*   Maintain **availability**, **confidentiality**, **data integrity**, and **authenticity**.

## Scheduling and Resource Management
*   Allocating processor time, memory, I/O.
*   Policies consider **fairness**, **differential responsiveness**, and **efficiency**.

## System Structure
*   New approaches: **microkernel architecture**, **multithreading**, **symmetric multiprocessing**, **distributed operating systems**, **object-oriented design**.
