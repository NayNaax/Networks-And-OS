# Memory Hierarchy

## Design Constraints on Computer Memory
*   **Capacity (How much?)**:  Desire for large capacity.
*   **Speed (How fast?)**: Must keep up with the processor.
*   **Cost (How expensive?)**: Reasonable cost.

## Levels of the Memory Hierarchy
*   **Registers**: Fastest, highest cost/bit (inside processor).
*   **Cache**: Small, fast (exploits locality).  Multiple levels (L1, L2, L3) are common.
*   **Main Memory**: Primary storage (volatile). Larger, lower cost/bit than cache.
*   **Secondary Memory (Auxiliary Memory)**: External, nonvolatile (e.g., disks). Larger, lower cost/bit than main memory.
*   **Off-line Storage**: Removable media (tape, CD-ROM). Largest capacity, lowest cost/bit, slowest access.

## Memory Hierarchy Relationships
Moving *down* the hierarchy:
*   **Decreasing cost per bit**
*   **Increasing capacity**
*   **Increasing access time**
*   **Decreasing frequency of processor access**

## Principle of Locality
*   Memory references tend to cluster.
*   **Temporal Locality**:  Recently accessed items are likely to be accessed again soon.
*   **Spatial Locality**:  Items near recently accessed items are likely to be accessed soon.
*   Data is organized to minimize access time across memory levels.
# Cache Memory

## Purpose of Cache Memory
*   **Small, fast memory** between processor and main memory.
*   **Exploits locality** to reduce average memory access time.
*   Improves processing speed by holding frequently accessed data/instructions.

## Cache and Main Memory Interaction
*   Data transferred in **blocks**.
*   **Cache Hit**: Data found in cache (fast access).
*   **Cache Miss**: Data *not* in cache; block transferred from main memory to cache.

## Cache Organisation
*   Single-level or multi-level (L1, L2, L3).

## Cache Design Considerations
*   **Cache size**
*   **Block size**
*   **Mapping function**
*   **Replacement algorithm**
*   **Write policy**
*   **Number of cache levels**
