# Instruction Execution

## Program Execution Overview
*   A program is a set of instructions in memory.
*   The processor fetches and executes instructions.
*   Two stages: **Fetch Stage** and **Execute Stage** (the instruction cycle).

## Instruction Cycle: Fetch Stage
1.  **Processor fetches an instruction from memory.**
2.  **Program Counter (PC)** holds the address of the next instruction.
3.  **PC is incremented after each fetch.**
4.  The instruction is **loaded into the Instruction Register (IR)**.

## Instruction Cycle: Execute Stage
The processor interprets the instruction and performs the action:
*   **Processor-memory**: Data transfer between processor and memory.
*   **Processor-I/O**: Data transfer between processor and I/O module.
*   **Data processing**: Arithmetic or logical operations on data.
*   **Control**: Altering execution sequence (jumps, branches).
# Interrupts

## Interrupt Definition and Purpose
*   **Mechanism to interrupt normal processor sequencing.**
*   **Improves processor utilization.**  Avoids wasteful waiting for slow I/O devices.

## Classes of Interrupts
*   **Program**: Result of instruction execution (overflow, division by zero, illegal instruction, invalid memory access).
*   **Timer**: Generated by a timer; allows regular OS functions.
*   **I/O**: Signal from an I/O controller (operation completion or error).
*   **Hardware Failure**: Power failure, memory parity error.

## Transfer of Control via Interrupts
1.  Normal execution is interrupted.
2.  Control transfers to an **Interrupt Handler**.
3.  Interrupt is handled.
4.  Control may return to the interrupted program.
