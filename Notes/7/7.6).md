# Information Protection and Security

## Main Issues
*   **Availability**:  Access to information and resources.
*   **Confidentiality**: Preventing unauthorized disclosure.
*   **Data integrity**: Protection from unauthorized modification.
*   **Authenticity**: Verifying identities and data sources.
# Scheduling and Resource Management

## Key Responsibility of an OS
*   **Managing resources** (processor, memory, I/O).

## Resource Allocation Policies
*   **Fairness**.
*   **Differential responsiveness**.
*   **Efficiency**.
# Different Architectural Approaches for OS

## Microkernel Architecture
*   **Few essential functions in the kernel** (address spaces, IPC, basic scheduling).
*   Other services as user-level processes.
*   **Benefits**: Simplicity, flexibility, distributed environment suitability.

## Multithreading
*   **Process divided into concurrently runnable threads.**
*   **Thread**: Dispatchable unit of work (context, stack).
*   **Process**: One or more threads + resources.
*   Improved modularity and timing control.

## Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
*   **Computer hardware architecture and OS behavior.**
*   **OS schedules threads/processes across all processors.**
*   **Transparency to the user.**
*   **Advantages**: Performance, availability, growth, scaling.

## Distributed Operating Systems
*   Illusion of single memory/storage space, unified access.
*   More complex than uniprocessor/SMP OS.

## Object-Oriented Design
*   Modular extensions to a small kernel.
*   Customization without disruption.
*   Eases distributed tool/OS development.
# Multithreading (Architectural Approach Details)

## Threads vs. Processes
(See definitions above).

## Benefits of Multithreading
*   **Modularity**.
*   **Finer-grained timing control**.
*   Shared memory/resources within a process (efficiency).
