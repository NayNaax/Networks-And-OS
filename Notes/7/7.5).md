# Process Management

## Definition of a Process
(See definitions under "Major Achievements").

## Causes of Errors in Concurrent Processes
*   **Nondeterminate program operation**: Unpredictable outcomes due to interleaving.
*   **Deadlocks**:  Processes blocked, waiting for each other.
*   **Improper synchronization**: Incorrect handling of signals.
*   **Failed mutual exclusion**: Simultaneous access to shared resources.

## Execution Context
*   **Essential for OS supervision and control.**
*   Includes:
    *   **Contents of process registers** (PC, general-purpose).
    *   **Process priority**, waiting status.

## Components of a Process
*   **Executable program (code)**.
*   **Associated data**.
*   **Execution context (process state)**.
# Memory Management

## Principal Storage Management Responsibilities
*   **Process isolation**.
*   **Automatic allocation and management**.
*   **Support of modular programming**.
*   **Protection and access control**.
*   **Long-term storage**.

## Virtual Memory
*   **Allows logical addressing independent of physical memory.**
*   Developed for multiple concurrent user jobs.

## Paging
*   Processes divided into **fixed-size pages**.
*   **Virtual address**: Page number + offset.
*   **Dynamic mapping** between virtual and real addresses (using the MMU).
