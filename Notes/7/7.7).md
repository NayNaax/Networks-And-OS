# Symmetric Multiprocessing (Architectural Approach Details)

## OS Role in SMP Systems
*   **Scheduling** across processors.
*   **Synchronization**.
*   **Load balancing**.
*   **Resource management**.

## Transparency to the User
* Parallelism managed by OS
# Distributed Operating System (Details)
*   Single system image across multiple computers.
*   Distributed file system.
*   Resource Sharing.
*   More Complex.
# Fault Tolerance
## Definition and Purpose
*   **System continues operating despite hardware/software faults.**
*   Involves **redundancy**.
*   **Increases reliability**.

## Costs
*   **Financial cost or performance impact**.
*   Extent of adoption depends on criticality.
# Fundamental Concepts of Fault Tolerance

## Reliability
*   **R(t)**: Probability of correct operation up to time *t*, given correct operation at *t*=0.

## MTTF and MTTR
*   **MTTF**: Average time to failure.
*   **MTTR**: Average time to repair.

## Availability
*   Fraction of time system is available.
*   Availability = MTTF / (MTTF + MTTR)

## Availability Classes
(Based on percentage of uptime, resulting annual downtime)
*   **Continuous**: 1.0 (0 downtime).
*   **Fault Tolerant**: 0.99999 (5 minutes).
*   **Fault Resilient**: 0.9999 (53 minutes).
*   **High Availability**: 0.999 (8.3 hours).
*   **Normal Availability**: 0.99 - 0.995 (44-87 hours).
# Faults

## Definition and Causes
(IEEE Standards Dictionary) Erroneous hardware/software state due to:
*   Component failure
*   Operator error
*   Environmental interference
*   Design error
*   Program error
*   Data structure error

A fault manifests as a **defect**.

## Permanent Faults
*   **Always present** after occurrence.
*   Requires component replacement/repair.

## Temporary Faults
*   **Not always present**.
    *   **Transient**: Occurs only once.
    *   **Intermittent**: Occurs multiple, unpredictable times.
# Methods of Redundancy

## Spatial (Physical) Redundancy
*   **Multiple components** (same function or backup).
*   Examples: Dual systems, TMR, spares.

## Temporal Redundancy
*   **Repeating a function/operation.**
*   Effective for **temporary faults**.
*   Not useful for permanent faults.
*   Examples: Retry, re-execute.

## Information Redundancy
*   **Replicating or coding data** for error detection/correction.
*   Examples: Parity bits, checksums, error-correcting codes.
