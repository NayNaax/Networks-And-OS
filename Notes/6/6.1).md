# Overall Network Operations: Synthesis

## A Day in the Life of a Web Request

This section provides a synthesis by tracing a web request (e.g., to www.google.com) from a laptop on a campus network.  This illustrates the interaction of protocols at different layers (Application, Transport, Network, Link).

### Scenario Breakdown

1.  **Connecting to the Internet (DHCP):**
    *   Laptop obtains IP address, first-hop router address, and DNS server address using DHCP.
    *   Involves DHCP request/response messages (encapsulated in UDP, IP, and Ethernet).
    *   ARP may be used to find the router's MAC address.

2.  **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):**
    *   Before sending a DNS query, the laptop needs the router's MAC address.
    *   ARP resolves the router's IP address to its MAC address.

3.  **Using DNS (Domain Name System):**
    *   Laptop queries DNS server (obtained via DHCP) for the IP address of www.google.com.
    *   DNS query is encapsulated in UDP, IP, and Ethernet.
    *   May traverse multiple networks (campus, ISP).
    *   DNS server responds with the IP address.

4.  **TCP Connection Carrying HTTP:**
    *   Laptop initiates a TCP connection to the web server (port 80).
    *   Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
    *   TCP segments are encapsulated in IP datagrams and Ethernet frames.

5.  **HTTP Request/Reply:**
    *   Browser sends an HTTP GET request.
    *   Request is carried in TCP segments, IP datagrams, and Ethernet frames.
    *   Web server sends back an HTTP reply (webpage content).
    *   Reply uses TCP, IP, and Ethernet, routing back to the laptop.

This example highlights the coordinated operation of DHCP, ARP, DNS, HTTP, TCP, IP, and Ethernet.
