# Switches vs. Routers

## Key Differences

Both store-and-forward devices, but:

*   **Switches:** Layer 2 (link layer).  Examine MAC addresses.
*   **Routers:** Layer 3 (network layer).  Examine IP addresses.

## Forwarding Tables

*   **Switches:**  Forwarding tables (MAC address tables).  Flooding/learning.
*   **Routers:** Routing tables.  Routing algorithms/protocols (RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP).

## Layer of Operation

*   **Switches:** Within a single LAN (or interconnected LAN segments).
*   **Routers:** Between different networks.
