# Subnets

*   **Definition:** A logically visible subdivision of an IP network. Devices within a subnet can communicate directly *without* going through a router.
*   **IP Address Structure:**  An IP address consists of a *network portion* (identifies the subnet) and a *host portion* (identifies a specific device on that subnet).
*   **Subnet Mask:**  Indicates which bits of the IP address belong to the network portion and which belong to the host portion.  (e.g., /24 means the first 24 bits are the network portion).
# Routing and Forwarding

*   **Forwarding:** The *process* a router uses to move a packet from an input interface to the appropriate output interface. This is a local, per-hop action.  It's determined by looking up the destination address in the *forwarding table* (also called the routing table).
*   **Routing:** The *network-wide process* that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination.  This involves routing protocols and algorithms.

# Routing Table

A routing table (or forwarding table) in a router contains the information needed to forward packets. Key components include:

*   **Destination Network/Prefix:**  The IP address range of the destination network.
*   **Next Hop Address:**  The IP address of the next router to send the packet to.
*   **Output Interface:** The router's physical interface to use to send the packet.
*   **Metric:**  A value indicating the "cost" of using a particular route (e.g., hop count, delay).
*   **Administrative Distance:** A value indicating the trustworthiness of the source of the routing information (lower is better).
# Routing Types

*   **Static Routing:**
    *   Routes are *manually* configured by a network administrator.
    *   **Advantages:** Simple, predictable, low overhead, secure.
    *   **Disadvantages:** Not scalable, no automatic adaptation to network changes, requires manual updates.
*   **Dynamic Routing:**
    *   Routers use *routing protocols* to automatically learn and update their routing tables.
    *   **Advantages:** Scalable, adapts to network changes, can provide load balancing.
    *   **Disadvantages:** More complex configuration, higher resource utilization (CPU, bandwidth), potential security concerns.
