# VMs VS Containers

## Key Differences

### Isolation

*   **VMs:** Full process isolation.  High computational overhead.
*   **Containers:** Leverage host OS mechanics.  Lower overhead, but less strong isolation.

### Overhead

*   **VMs:** Significant overhead from virtualizing hardware. Each VM needs its own OS.
*   **Containers:** Low overhead due to shared OS kernel.  Higher application density.
