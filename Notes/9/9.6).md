# Kubernetes

## Kubernetes Introduction

*   Open-source orchestrator for deploying containerized applications.
*   Developed by Google.
*   Benefits: Velocity Scaling, Abstracting Infrastructure, Efficiency.

## Velocity

*   Helps move quickly while maintaining availability.
*   Concepts:
    *   **Immutability**
    *   **Declarative configuration**
    *   **Online self-healing systems**

### Immutability

*   Build a new, complete image instead of incremental updates.
*   Replace the old container with a new one.

### Declarative Configuration

*   Define the *desired* state, not a series of instructions.
*   Kubernetes works to achieve and maintain the state.

### Self-Healing Systems

*   Continuously ensures the current state matches the desired state.
*   Guards against failures.

## Kubernetes Architecture

*   **Nodes**: VMs or physical servers hosting applications.
*   **Image Registry**: Stores container images.
*   **Pods**: Smallest unit of deployment.  Contain one or more containers.
