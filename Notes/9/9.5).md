# Docker Files

## Motivation for Docker Files

*   Automates the process of Docker image creation. Avoids manual, error-prone steps.

## Definition of a Docker File

*   Simple text file with instructions for building a Docker container image.
*   List of CLI instructions.
*   `docker build` creates an automated build.

## Key Concepts: Image vs. Container (Recap)

*   **Image:** Static, read-only file (template).
*   **Container:** Running instance of an image, writeable.

## Quick Run of Docker Files (Example)

1.  Create a directory.
2.  Change to the directory.
3.  Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension).
4.  Write the Dockerfile content.
5.  Build the container: `docker build`.
6.  Run the container: `docker run`.

*Good practice: Each Dockerfile in its own directory.*

## Docker File Content Example (Apache2 on Debian)

```dockerfile
FROM debian:stable
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl","-D","FOREGROUND"]
