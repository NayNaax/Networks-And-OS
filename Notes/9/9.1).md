# Virtual Machines (VMs)

## Definition of a Virtual Machine

*   An abstraction of a complete compute environment (processor, memory, and I/O).
*   Turns one physical server into many servers.

## The Hypervisor

*   Specialised system software that manages and runs virtual machines.
*   Allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine (the host).

## CAPEX vs OPEX Implications

### Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)

*   Major, long-term expenses (e.g., buildings, equipment).
*   VM OS licenses are a capital expenditure.
*   Cannot be deducted from income for tax purposes.

### Operating Expenses (OPEX)

*   Day-to-day expenses (e.g., salaries, rent, utilities).
*   VM maintenance and updates are operating expenses.
*   Can be deducted from taxes.
*   Virtualisation can *lower* OpEx through automation and simplified provisioning.

## Advantages of VMs

*   Minimise hardware costs (CapEx).
*   Easy migration to other data centers.
*   Foundation for disaster recovery.
*   Simplified hardware maintenance.
*   Resource optimization (follow the sun/moon, cheap power).
*   Consolidate idle workloads.
*   Power conservation.
*   Easier automation (lower OpEx).
*   Scalability and flexibility.

## Disadvantages of VMs

*   Each VM requires its own OS.
*   Each OS requires a license (CapEx).
*   OS overhead (compute and storage).
*   Maintenance and updates (OpEx).
