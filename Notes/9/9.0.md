# Virtualisation

## Introduction to Virtualisation and Cloud

*   Topic: Virtualisation and Cloud
*   Module: Network and Operating Systems
*   Lecture Focus: Introduction to Virtualisation, Virtual Machines, Containers, Docker, Docker Files, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

## Definition of Virtualisation

*   **Exposing a resource among multiple virtual entities.**
*   **Taking multiple physical resources and making them appear as a single abstraction.**
*   **Emulation:** Creating a virtual environment that emulates the hardware and software of another system.

## Virtualisation Implementation Techniques

### Multiplexing

*   Exposing a single resource to multiple virtual entities.

### Clustering or Aggregation

*   Taking multiple physical resources and presenting them as a single, unified abstraction.

### Emulation

*   Creating a virtual environment that completely mimics the hardware and software of a different system.

## Benefits of Virtualisation

### Operating System Diversity

*   Enables a diversity of operating systems to run concurrently on a single machine.

### Server Consolidation

*   Running a single application per (virtual) server.  Reduces the number of physical machines.

### Rapid Provisioning

*   VMs can be created and deployed much faster than physical servers.

### Security

*   New management layer provides control over all I/O operations. Enables VM-specific firewalls and virtual networks.

### High-Availability

*   VMs can be run on any compatible hypervisor, facilitating high-availability.

### Distributed Resource Scheduling

*   Live migration technologies enable automatic and transparent rebalancing of VMs within a cluster.

### Cloud Computing

*   Provides the fundamental technology for cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Google Compute Engine, Azure).  Tenants run isolated VMs on shared infrastructure.

## Types of Virtualisation

*   **Server Virtualisation:** Virtualising server hardware.
*   **Desktop Virtualisation:** Virtualising desktop environments.
*   **Storage Virtualisation:** Abstracting physical storage resources.
*   **Network Virtualisation:** Abstracting network resources.

# Virtual Machines (VMs)

## Definition of a Virtual Machine

*   An abstraction of a complete compute environment (processor, memory, and I/O).
*   Turns one physical server into many servers.

## The Hypervisor

*   Specialised system software that manages and runs virtual machines.
*   Allows multiple VMs to run on a single physical machine (the host).

## CAPEX vs OPEX Implications

### Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)

*   Major, long-term expenses (e.g., buildings, equipment).
*   VM OS licenses are a capital expenditure.
*   Cannot be deducted from income for tax purposes.

### Operating Expenses (OPEX)

*   Day-to-day expenses (e.g., salaries, rent, utilities).
*   VM maintenance and updates are operating expenses.
*   Can be deducted from taxes.
*   Virtualisation can *lower* OpEx through automation and simplified provisioning.

## Advantages of VMs

*   Minimise hardware costs (CapEx).
*   Easy migration to other data centers.
*   Foundation for disaster recovery.
*   Simplified hardware maintenance.
*   Resource optimization (follow the sun/moon, cheap power).
*   Consolidate idle workloads.
*   Power conservation.
*   Easier automation (lower OpEx).
*   Scalability and flexibility.

## Disadvantages of VMs

*   Each VM requires its own OS.
*   Each OS requires a license (CapEx).
*   OS overhead (compute and storage).
*   Maintenance and updates (OpEx).

# Containers

## Definition of Containers

*   Application layer abstraction packaging code and dependencies.
*   Multiple containers share the same OS kernel.
*   Each container runs as an isolated process in user space.

## Advantages of Containers

### Less Space and Resource Usage

*   Smaller than VMs (tens of megabytes).
*   Handle more applications.
*   Fewer VMs and operating systems required.
*   Provide isolation with a fraction of the computing power of VMs.

### Portability and Consistency

*   Logical packaging mechanism abstracting applications from the environment.
*   Consistent deployment regardless of target environment.
*   Predictable and isolated environments.

### Improved Efficiency

*   Granular control over resources.
*   Improved infrastructure efficiency.

# VMs VS Containers

## Key Differences

### Isolation

*   **VMs:** Full process isolation.  High computational overhead.
*   **Containers:** Leverage host OS mechanics.  Lower overhead, but less strong isolation.

### Overhead

*   **VMs:** Significant overhead from virtualizing hardware. Each VM needs its own OS.
*   **Containers:** Low overhead due to shared OS kernel.  Higher application density.

# Docker

## Introduction to Docker

*   Open-source containerisation platform.
*   Packages applications into standardised executable components.
*   Simplifies delivery of distributed applications.

## Docker Images and Containers

### Docker Images

*   Contain executable application source code, tools, libraries, and dependencies.
*   Read-only files (templates).
*   Used to create containers.

### Docker Containers

*   Live, running instances of Docker images.
*   Live, ephemeral, and executable content.
*   Writeable.

## Docker Daemon

*   Service running on the OS.
*   Creates and manages Docker images.
*   Control centre of Docker.

## Docker Hub

*   Public repository of Docker images.
*   Over 100,000 container images.
*   Allows sharing and downloading of images.

## Installing Docker

*   Instructions available for Docker Desktop (Windows) and Docker Engine (Ubuntu).

# Docker Files

## Motivation for Docker Files

*   Automates the process of Docker image creation. Avoids manual, error-prone steps.

## Definition of a Docker File

*   Simple text file with instructions for building a Docker container image.
*   List of CLI instructions.
*   `docker build` creates an automated build.

## Key Concepts: Image vs. Container (Recap)

*   **Image:** Static, read-only file (template).
*   **Container:** Running instance of an image, writeable.

## Quick Run of Docker Files (Example)

1.  Create a directory.
2.  Change to the directory.
3.  Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension).
4.  Write the Dockerfile content.
5.  Build the container: `docker build`.
6.  Run the container: `docker run`.

*Good practice: Each Dockerfile in its own directory.*

## Docker File Content Example (Apache2 on Debian)

```dockerfile
FROM debian:stable
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl","-D","FOREGROUND"]
