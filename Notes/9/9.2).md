# Containers

## Definition of Containers

*   Application layer abstraction packaging code and dependencies.
*   Multiple containers share the same OS kernel.
*   Each container runs as an isolated process in user space.

## Advantages of Containers

### Less Space and Resource Usage

*   Smaller than VMs (tens of megabytes).
*   Handle more applications.
*   Fewer VMs and operating systems required.
*   Provide isolation with a fraction of the computing power of VMs.

### Portability and Consistency

*   Logical packaging mechanism abstracting applications from the environment.
*   Consistent deployment regardless of target environment.
*   Predictable and isolated environments.

### Improved Efficiency

*   Granular control over resources.
*   Improved infrastructure efficiency.
