# Virtualisation

## Introduction to Virtualisation and Cloud

*   Topic: Virtualisation and Cloud
*   Module: Network and Operating Systems
*   Lecture Focus: Introduction to Virtualisation, Virtual Machines, Containers, Docker, Docker Files, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes.

## Definition of Virtualisation

*   **Exposing a resource among multiple virtual entities.**
*   **Taking multiple physical resources and making them appear as a single abstraction.**
*   **Emulation:** Creating a virtual environment that emulates the hardware and software of another system.

## Virtualisation Implementation Techniques

### Multiplexing

*   Exposing a single resource to multiple virtual entities.

### Clustering or Aggregation

*   Taking multiple physical resources and presenting them as a single, unified abstraction.

### Emulation

*   Creating a virtual environment that completely mimics the hardware and software of a different system.

## Benefits of Virtualisation

### Operating System Diversity

*   Enables a diversity of operating systems to run concurrently on a single machine.

### Server Consolidation

*   Running a single application per (virtual) server.  Reduces the number of physical machines.

### Rapid Provisioning

*   VMs can be created and deployed much faster than physical servers.

### Security

*   New management layer provides control over all I/O operations. Enables VM-specific firewalls and virtual networks.

### High-Availability

*   VMs can be run on any compatible hypervisor, facilitating high-availability.

### Distributed Resource Scheduling

*   Live migration technologies enable automatic and transparent rebalancing of VMs within a cluster.

### Cloud Computing

*   Provides the fundamental technology for cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Google Compute Engine, Azure).  Tenants run isolated VMs on shared infrastructure.

## Types of Virtualisation

*   **Server Virtualisation:** Virtualising server hardware.
*   **Desktop Virtualisation:** Virtualising desktop environments.
*   **Storage Virtualisation:** Abstracting physical storage resources.
*   **Network Virtualisation:** Abstracting network resources.
