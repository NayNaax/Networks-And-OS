# DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

*   **Purpose:**  Allows devices to automatically obtain an IP address and other network configuration information when they join a network.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Simplifies network administration (no manual configuration).
    *   Allows for efficient reuse of IP addresses (addresses are leased, not permanently assigned).
    *   Supports mobile devices that move between networks.

## DHCP Process (simplified)

1.  **DHCP Discover:** Client broadcasts a request for a DHCP server.
2.  **DHCP Offer:**  DHCP server(s) respond with an offer of an IP address and configuration.
3.  **DHCP Request:** Client selects an offer and requests the offered IP address.
4.  **DHCP ACK:** Server acknowledges the request and assigns the IP address for a specific lease period.
