# Key Internet Layer Functions

*   **Packet forwarding:** The data plane handles the actual movement of packets between router interfaces.
*   **Applying Policies:** Routers can enforce policies such as Quality of Service (QoS) or access control lists (ACLs).
*   **Ensuring efficient transmission:**  The goal is to minimize delay and maximize efficiency.
*   **Routing protocol operations:** The control plane determines routes and maintains routing tables using protocols like OSPF, BGP, and RIP.
*   **Network topology management:**  Routing protocols also handle changes and updates to the network topology.
*   **Route selection:**  The control plane computes and selects the optimal path for packets.
*   **Error Handling:**  The Internet Layer can detect and report errors using ICMP (e.g., sending a "Destination Unreachable" message).
