# Core Internet Layer Concepts

*   **Logical Addressing:**  IP addresses provide a location that is independent of the physical network (like mailing addresses).
*   **Routing:**  Determining the optimal path for data packets (routers are like post offices, routing protocols are like postal routes).
*   **Packetization:**  Encapsulating Transport Layer segments into IP Datagrams (packets).
*   **Fragmentation/Reassembly:**  Splitting packets that are larger than a network link's Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), and reassembling them at the destination.
*   **Connectionless Service:**  A best-effort delivery service; no guarantees of delivery, order, or error-free transmission.
*   **IP (Internet Protocol):** The primary protocol (with versions IPv4 and IPv6).
*   **Hop-by-hop delivery:**  Packets are delivered from one router to the next, rather than directly from source to destination.
