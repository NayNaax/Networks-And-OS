# Routing Metrics

Routing protocols use metrics to determine the best path to a destination. Common metrics include:

*   **Hop Count:** The number of routers a packet must traverse.
*   **Latency (Delay):** The time it takes for a packet to travel from source to destination.
*   **Bandwidth:** The data capacity of a link.
*   **Reliability:**  A measure of the link's error rate.
*   **Load:** The current traffic utilization of a link.
*   **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):** The largest packet size a link can handle.
*   **Cost:**  An administrative value assigned to a link (can represent a combination of factors).
# Routing Protocols

## RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

*   An older, *distance-vector* routing protocol.
*   Uses *hop count* as its metric (maximum 15 hops).
*   Simple to configure, but not suitable for large or complex networks (slow convergence, limited hop count).
## OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)

*   A *link-state* routing protocol.
*   Uses *Dijkstra's algorithm* to calculate the shortest path to each destination.
*   Supports hierarchical networks (areas) for better scalability.
*   Fast convergence (reacts quickly to network changes).
* More complex then RIP.
## BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)

*   A *path-vector* routing protocol.
*   Used primarily on the *Internet backbone* to exchange routing information between *Autonomous Systems (ASes)*.
*   Emphasizes *policy-based routing* (allows administrators to define routing policies based on business relationships, traffic engineering, etc.).
*   Extremely scalable, but complex to configure.
