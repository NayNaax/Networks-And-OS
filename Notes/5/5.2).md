# Data Plane vs. Control Plane

The Internet Layer's operation is divided into two key aspects:

*   **Data Plane:**
    *   Responsible for the *actual movement* of packets from input to output interfaces.
    *   Includes forwarding (looking up destination addresses in the routing table), applying NAT, and packet filtering.
    *   Operates at high speed and in real-time.
*   **Control Plane:**
    *   *Determines* the routes that packets should take.
    *   Involves path computation and maintaining the routing tables.
    *   Relies on routing protocols (BGP, OSPF, RIP) to learn and update routing information.
    *   Handles network topology changes.
    *   Operates in the background, typically slower than the data plane.
