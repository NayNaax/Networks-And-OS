# IPv6

## Motivation

*   **Primary Motivation:**  The exhaustion of the IPv4 address space.
*   **Additional Benefits:**
    *   Simplified header for faster processing.
    *   Better support for Quality of Service (QoS).
    *   Built-in security features (IPsec).

# IPv6 Header

*   128-bit addresses (vastly larger address space than IPv4).
*   Simplified header compared to IPv4:
    *   *No* checksum (error detection is handled by lower layers).
    *   *No* fragmentation at routers (hosts are responsible for Path MTU Discovery).
    *   Options are handled via *extension headers*, making the base header fixed-size.
# IPv6 Transition

*   The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 is a long and complex process because it's not possible to switch the entire Internet over at once.
*   Key Transition Mechanisms:
    *   **Dual-Stack:**  Devices run both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously.
    *   **Tunneling:**  Encapsulate IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets to traverse IPv4-only networks.
    *    **Translation** Allows IPv4 only and IPv6 only hosts to communicate.
# IPv6 Adoption

*   Adoption has been slower than initially anticipated, but it is steadily increasing.  Factors contributing to the slow adoption include the widespread use of NAT (which mitigates IPv4 exhaustion) and the complexity of upgrading network infrastructure.
