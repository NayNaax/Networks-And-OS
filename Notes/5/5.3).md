# IPv4 Addressing

*   IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers, usually written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
*   This provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

# IPv4 Address Classes (Historical)

These classes are largely obsolete due to CIDR, but understanding them provides context:

*   **Class A:** For very large networks.  Default subnet mask: /8. (e.g., 10.0.0.1)
*   **Class B:** For medium-sized networks. Default subnet mask: /16. (e.g., 172.16.0.1)
*   **Class C:** For small networks. Default subnet mask: /24. (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
*   **Class D:** Reserved for multicast addressing.
*   **Class E:** Reserved for experimental purposes.

# Special IPv4 Addresses

*   **Private Addresses:**  Used within private networks, *not* routable on the public internet.  Commonly used with NAT:
    *   10.0.0.0/8
    *   172.16.0.0/12
    *   192.168.0.0/16
*   **Loopback:** 127.0.0.1 (used for a host to communicate with itself).
*   **Broadcast:** 255.255.255.255 (sends a message to all devices on the *local* network).
*   **Link-Local (APIPA):** 169.254.0.0/16 (used when a device fails to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server).
