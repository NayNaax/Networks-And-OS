# CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)

*   CIDR provides a more flexible and efficient way to allocate IP addresses than the classful system.
*   It allows for variable-length subnet masks, meaning the network portion of an IP address can be any number of bits.
*   Addresses are written in the form a.b.c.d/x, where 'x' is the number of bits in the network portion (the subnet mask).
*   Example: 200.23.16.0/23 means the first 23 bits represent the network, and the remaining 9 bits represent hosts within that network.
