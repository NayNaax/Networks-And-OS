# NAT (Network Address Translation)

*   **Function:** Allows multiple devices on a private network to share a *single* public IPv4 address.
*   **How it works:**
    *   Devices on the private network use private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
    *   The NAT router has a public IP address.
    *   When a device on the private network sends a packet to the internet, the NAT router:
        *   Changes the source IP address to its own public IP address.
        *   Changes the source port number to a unique, unused port number.
        *   Keeps track of this translation in a NAT translation table.
    *   When a response comes back, the NAT router uses the destination port number to look up the corresponding private IP address and port in its table and forwards the packet to the correct internal device.

## Advantages of NAT

*   **IP Address Conservation:**  Significantly reduces the need for public IPv4 addresses.
*   **Security:**  Internal devices are not directly exposed to the internet.
*   **Flexibility:**  Internal network addresses can be changed without affecting external communication.

## Disadvantages/Criticism of NAT

*   **Violates Layering:**  NAT operates at both the network layer (IP addresses) and the transport layer (port numbers).
*   **Breaks End-to-End Connectivity:**  Makes it difficult for external devices to initiate connections to devices behind a NAT.
*   **Complexity:**  Can complicate certain applications and protocols that rely on specific port numbers or direct connections.1
