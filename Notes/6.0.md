# Network Access Layer (Link Layer) Overview

## Module Outline

This section covers the Network Access Layer (also known as the Link Layer), the sixth topic in the module.  It builds upon previous layers (Application, Transport, and Network). Key areas include:

*   **Introduction**
*   **Error Detection and Correction**
*   **Multiple Access Protocols**
*   **LANs (Local Area Networks)**
*   **Addressing and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
*   **Ethernet**
*   **Switches**
*   **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**

## Link Layer Fundamentals

### Terminology

*   **Nodes:** Hosts and routers.
*   **Links:** Communication channels connecting *adjacent* nodes (wired, wireless, LANs).
*   **Frame:** A layer-2 packet, encapsulating a network-layer datagram.

### Responsibility

The link layer's primary responsibility is to **transfer a datagram between two *physically adjacent* nodes over a single link**.

## Link Layer Services

1.  **Framing and Link Access:**
    *   Encapsulates datagrams into frames (adding header/trailer).
    *   Manages channel access on shared media.
    *   Uses **MAC addresses** (distinct from IP addresses) in frame headers to identify source and destination nodes on the link.

2.  **Reliable Delivery (between adjacent nodes):**
    *   Seldom used on low-error links.
    *   More common on wireless links (higher error rates).
    *   Note:  Link-level reliability is distinct from end-to-end (e.g., TCP) reliability.

3.  **Flow Control:** Pacing data transmission between adjacent nodes.

4.  **Error Detection:**
    *   Detects errors caused by signal attenuation and noise.
    *   Receiver can signal retransmission or drop the frame.

5.  **Error Correction:**
    *   Receiver identifies and *corrects* bit errors without retransmission.

6.  **Half-Duplex and Full-Duplex:** Supports both communication modes.

## Link Layer Implementation

*   **Location:** Implemented in *every* host, specifically in the **Network Interface Card (NIC)** or on-chip (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi).
*   **Function:**  Attaches to the host's system bus (e.g., PCI).  A combination of hardware, software, and firmware.
*   **Sending Side:** Encapsulates datagram, adds error checking, reliable data transfer (if used), and flow control.
*   **Receiving Side:** Checks for errors, handles reliable data transfer, flow control, extracts datagram, and passes it to the network layer.

## Error Detection & Correction Details

### EDC Bits

*   Error Detection and Correction (EDC) bits add **redundancy** to the transmitted data (D).
*   Receiver checks if received data (D') and EDC (EDC') are error-free.
*   Error detection is not 100% reliable, but large EDC fields improve detection/correction.

### Parity Checking

*   **Single-bit parity:** Detects single-bit errors.
*   **Two-dimensional bit parity:** Detects *and corrects* single-bit errors.

### Internet Checksum (Review)

*   Used in UDP (and other protocols).
*   Sender calculates the one's complement sum of 16-bit integers in the segment.
*   Receiver checks if the calculated checksum matches the checksum field.  Mismatches indicate errors.

### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

*   **More powerful** error-detection coding than checksum.
*   Uses a generator bit pattern (G) to calculate CRC bits (R) based on the data bits (D).
*   Receiver uses G to check for errors in the received D R bit pattern.

# Multiple Access Protocols

## Types of Links

1.  **Point-to-point:** Dedicated connection (e.g., Ethernet switch to host, PPP).
2.  **Broadcast (shared wire or medium):** Multiple nodes share the same communication medium (e.g., old Ethernet, upstream HFC, 802.11 wireless, 4G/5G, satellite).

## The Challenge

*   Simultaneous transmissions on a shared broadcast channel cause **collisions** (interference).

## The Role of Multiple Access Protocols

*   A **distributed algorithm** to determine **how nodes share the channel** and **when they can transmit**.
*   Coordination must occur *using the channel itself* (no out-of-band communication).

## Ideal Multiple Access Protocol

An ideal protocol for a channel of rate *R* bps would have:

1.  **Efficiency (single user):**  Full rate *R* when only one node transmits.
2.  **Fairness (multiple users):** Average rate *R/M* when *M* nodes transmit.
3.  **Decentralization:** No special coordinating node, no clock/slot synchronization.
4.  **Simplicity:** Easy to implement.

## MAC Protocol Taxonomy

1.  **Channel Partitioning:** Divide channel into pieces (time slots, frequencies, codes).
2.  **Random Access:** Allow collisions, but include mechanisms to recover.
3.  **"Taking Turns":** Nodes take turns transmitting.

# Channel Partitioning MAC Protocols

## TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)

*   Access in "rounds."
*   Each station gets a fixed-length time slot in each round.
*   Unused slots go idle.

## FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access)

*   Divides spectrum into frequency bands.
*   Each station gets a fixed frequency band.
*   Unused frequency bands remain idle.

# Random Access Protocols

## General Principles

*   Transmit at full channel rate *R*.
*   No prior coordination.
*   Collisions are possible.
*   Protocols specify:
    *   How to *detect* collisions.
    *   How to *recover* from collisions (e.g., delayed retransmissions).
*   Examples: ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA.

## Pure (Unslotted) ALOHA

*   Simplest, no synchronization.
*   Transmit immediately when a frame arrives.
*   High collision probability.
*   Efficiency is low (around 18%).

## Slotted ALOHA

*   Assumptions:
    *   Equal-size frames.
    *   Time divided into equal-size slots.
    *   Nodes start transmitting only at slot beginnings.
    *   Nodes are synchronized.
    *   Collision detection.

*   Operation:
    *   Transmit in next slot.
    *   If no collision, send new frame in next slot.
    *   If collision, retransmit with probability *p* in subsequent slots.

*   Pros: Single active node can transmit at full rate, highly decentralized, simple.

*   Cons: Collisions waste slots, idle slots, clock synchronization needed.

*   Efficiency:  Maximum efficiency is around 37% (1/e).

## CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)

*   **"Listen before transmit."**
*   If channel idle, transmit entire frame.
*   If channel busy, defer transmission.
*Collisions are still possible due to propagation delays.

## CSMA/CD (CSMA with Collision Detection)

*   Detect collisions quickly.
*   Abort colliding transmissions to reduce wasted time.
*   Easier in wired than wireless networks.
*   CSMA and propagation delay are a large factor in collisions.

## CSMA/CD Algorithm (Ethernet)

1.  NIC receives datagram, creates frame.
2.  Sense channel:
    *   Idle: Start transmission.
    *   Busy: Wait for idle, then transmit.
3.  If entire frame transmitted without collision, done.
4.  If collision detected, abort and send *jam signal*.
5.  Enter **binary (exponential) backoff:**
    *   After *m*th collision, choose random *K* from {0, 1, ..., 2<sup>m</sup> - 1}.
    *   Wait *K* \* 512 bit times, then retry (Step 2).  Longer backoff with more collisions.

## CSMA/CD Efficiency

*   Efficiency: 1 / (1 + 5 \* Tprop / Ttrans)
    *  Tprop is the max propogation delay
    * Ttrans is the time to transmit max-size frame
*   Better than ALOHA; simple, cheap, decentralized.

# "Taking Turns" MAC Protocols

## Motivation

Combine advantages of channel partitioning (efficiency at high load) and random access (efficiency at low load).

## Polling

*   Master node "invites" slaves to transmit in turn.
*   Concerns: Polling overhead, latency, single point of failure.

## Token Passing

*   Control token passed sequentially.
*   Node with token can transmit.
*   Concerns: Token overhead, latency, single point of failure (lost token).

# Cable Access Network: Hybrid Approach

*Cable uses a combination of FDM, TDM, and Random Access.
* **CMTS** at the **cable headend**.
*   **Downstream**: Multiple (broadcast) FDM channels (data, TV, control).
*   **Upstream**: Multiple channels.  Multiple access is a *mix*: contention (random access) for requests/small data; assigned slots (TDM).
*   **DOCSIS** standard.  Downstream MAP frame assigns upstream slots.  Cable modems request slots using random access (binary backoff).

# Summary of MAC Protocols

*   **Channel Partitioning:** TDMA, FDMA.
*   **Random Access:** ALOHA, S-ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD (Ethernet), CSMA/CA (802.11).
*   **Taking Turns:** Polling, token passing.

# LANs Overview

Transitioning to Local Area Networks (LANs).  Topics include addressing, ARP, Ethernet, switches.

# MAC Addresses

## Purpose

*   **32-bit IP address:** Network-layer address for layer-3 forwarding.
*   **MAC address (LAN/physical/Ethernet address):** Used *locally* to get a frame from one interface to another *physically-connected* interface on the *same* subnet.

## Format and Allocation

*   **48-bit** MAC address (burned into NIC ROM, sometimes software-settable).
*   Hexadecimal notation (e.g., 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD).
*   Each interface has a *unique* MAC address.
*   Allocation administered by IEEE. Manufacturers buy portions of address space.

## Flat Addressing

*   MAC addresses are *flat* (no location information).
*   **Portability:**  Interface can move between LANs and keep the same MAC address.
*   IP addresses are *not* portable (depend on subnet).

# ARP: Address Resolution Protocol

## The Need for ARP

*   ARP answers: **How to determine an interface's MAC address given its IP address?**

## ARP Table

*   Each IP node (host, router) has an ARP table.
*   Entries: IP address, MAC address, TTL (Time To Live).
*   TTL: Time after which mapping is forgotten (typically 20 mins).

## ARP Protocol in Action

Example: A (IP: 137.196.7.23, MAC: 71-65-F7-2B-08-53) sends to B (IP: 137.196.7.14, MAC: 58-23-D7-FA-20-B0).

1.  **ARP Query:** If B's MAC isn't in A's table, A *broadcasts* an ARP query (destination MAC = FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF).  All nodes receive it. Query includes A's MAC/IP and B's IP.

2.  **ARP Reply:** B receives query, matches IP, sends ARP response *directly* to A (destination MAC = A's MAC). Response contains B's MAC.

3.  **ARP Table Update:** A receives reply, extracts B's MAC, adds to ARP table (with TTL).

# Routing to Another Subnet: Addressing Walkthrough

Sending a datagram from host A (subnet 1) to host B (subnet 2) via router R.

Assumptions: A knows B's IP, A knows first-hop router R's IP, A knows R's MAC.

1.  **A Creates IP Datagram:** Source IP = A, Destination IP = B.

2.  **A Creates Link-Layer Frame (A to R):**
    *   Source MAC = A's MAC.
    *   Destination MAC = R's MAC (on A's LAN).
    *   Payload = IP datagram.

3.  **Frame Transmission (A to R).**

4.  **R Receives Frame:** Removes frame, passes IP datagram to IP layer.  R examines destination IP (B) and determines outgoing interface.

5.  **R Creates Link-Layer Frame (R to B's LAN):**
    *   Source MAC = R's MAC (on B's LAN).
    *   Destination MAC = B's MAC (obtained via ARP on B's LAN).
    *   Payload = IP datagram (Source IP = A, Destination IP = B).

6.  **Frame Transmission (R to B).**

7.  **B Receives Frame:**  NIC passes datagram to IP layer.

*Key Point:* IP addresses in the datagram stay the same (A to B). MAC addresses in the frames change at each hop (A to R, then R to B).

# Ethernet Technology

## Ethernet Overview

*   **Dominant** wired LAN technology.
*   First widely used LAN technology.
*   Simpler and cheaper.
*   Kept up with speed: 10 Mbps to 400 Gbps.
*   Modern NICs often support multiple speeds.

## Physical Topology

*   **Bus (Historical):**  All nodes in same collision domain.
*   **Switched (Modern):** Active link-layer 2 switch in center.  Each host has dedicated connection to switch.  Separate Ethernet protocols on each link; no collisions between hosts on different ports.

## Ethernet Frame Structure

*   **Preamble:** 7 bytes (10101010) + 1 byte (10101011) for synchronization.
*   **Destination Address:** 6-byte MAC address.
*   **Source Address:** 6-byte MAC address.
*   **Type:** Indicates higher-layer protocol (e.g., IP).
*   **Data (Payload):**  IP datagram (or other).
*   **CRC:** 4-byte error detection code.

## Ethernet: Unreliable and Connectionless

*   **Connectionless:** No handshaking.
*   **Unreliable:** No ACKs or NAKs at the link layer.  Dropped frames are lost unless higher-layer protocols recover them.
*   MAC protocol: unslotted CSMA/CD with binary backoff.

## 802.3 Ethernet Standards

*   Many different standards (physical layer, data rates).
*   Common MAC protocol (CSMA/CD) and frame format.
*   Speeds: 2 Mbps, 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, 40 Gbps, etc.

# Switches in Ethernet Networks

## Ethernet Switch Functionality

*   **Link-layer (layer 2) device.**  *Active* role.
*   **Store and forward** Ethernet frames.
*   Examines destination MAC address, selectively forwards to one or more outgoing links.
*   Uses CSMA/CD to access segment (if shared-medium Ethernet), but modern switched Ethernet uses separate collision domains per port.

## Transparency and Self-Learning

*   **Transparent:** Hosts unaware of switches.
*   **Plug-and-play, self-learning:** No manual configuration.

## Multiple Simultaneous Transmissions

*   Hosts have dedicated connections to switch.
*   Switches buffer packets.
*   Each link to switch runs full-duplex Ethernet.  *No collisions* between hosts on different ports.

## Switch Forwarding Table

*   Switch learns which hosts are reachable through which interfaces.
*   Table entries: MAC address, interface, time stamp (TTL).
*   Similar to a routing table, but at Layer 2 (MAC addresses).

## How Switch Table Entries are Created and Maintained

*   **Self-learning:** When a frame arrives, switch "learns" sender's location (source MAC, incoming interface).  Timestamp is recorded/updated.

## Switch Frame Filtering and Forwarding

1.  Record incoming link and source MAC in table.
2.  Lookup destination MAC in table.
3.  If entry found:
    *   Same segment: *Drop* frame.
    *   Different segment: Forward on indicated interface.
4.  If no entry found: *Flood* (forward on all interfaces *except* the one it arrived on).

## Interconnecting Switches

*   Self-learning works seamlessly across interconnected switches.
*   Flooding propagates across switches until destination is found.

## Example of Self-Learning in a Multi-Switch Network

Example provided with C sending to I, and I responding to C, showing how switches learn the locations.

# Switches vs. Routers

## Key Differences

Both store-and-forward, but:

*   **Switches:** Layer 2 (link layer).  Examine MAC addresses.
*   **Routers:** Layer 3 (network layer).  Examine IP addresses.

## Forwarding Tables

*   **Switches:**  Forwarding tables (MAC address tables).  Flooding/learning.
*   **Routers:** Routing tables.  Routing algorithms/protocols (RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, BGP).

## Layer of Operation

*   **Switches:** Within a single LAN (or interconnected LAN segments).
*   **Routers:** Between different networks.
