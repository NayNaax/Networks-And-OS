# Transport Layer Fundamentals

## Introduction

The transport layer provides **end-to-end communication** between applications on different hosts, building on the network layer's host-to-host communication.

Key topics:

*   **Reliable data transfer**: Ensuring correct and in-order data delivery.
*   **Multiplexing and demultiplexing**: Multiple application sessions over one network connection.
*   **Connectionless transport (UDP)**: Lightweight, unreliable transport.
*   **Connection-oriented transport (TCP)**: Reliable, connection-based transport.
*   **Congestion control**: Managing network congestion.

## Reliable Data Transfer (RDT)

### rdt3.0 (Stop-and-Wait)

rdt3.0 is a **stop-and-wait** protocol.  The sender transmits one packet and waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) before sending the next.

Scenarios:

*   **(a) No loss**: Sender sends packets, receiver ACKs.
*   **(b) Packet loss**: Sender **timeouts** and resends lost packets.
*   **(c) ACK loss**: Sender retransmits; receiver detects **duplicate** and re-acknowledges.
*   **(d) Premature timeout/delayed ACK**: Sender resends; receiver **ignores** duplicate and resends ACK.

### Performance of rdt3.0

**Utilization (U_sender)** is low due to stop-and-wait:

U_sender = (L/R) / (RTT + L/R)

Where:

*   L = Packet length (bits)
*   R = Link bandwidth (bps)
*   RTT = Round-trip time (propagation delay * 2)

Example: 1 Gbps link, 15ms propagation, 8000-bit packet:

U_sender ≈ 0.00027  (**Very poor performance**)

## Pipelined Protocols

### Operation

**Pipelining** allows sending multiple packets without waiting for each ACK, increasing utilization.

Requirements:

*   **Increased sequence number range**: For multiple in-flight packets.
*   **Buffering**: Sender buffers for retransmission; receiver may buffer out-of-order packets.

### Increased Utilization

Pipelining significantly improves utilization.  With N-packet pipelining:

U_sender ≈ (N * L/R) / (RTT + L/R)

## Go-Back-N (GBN)

### Sender Operation

Sender maintains a **window** of up to N unacknowledged packets.

*   **k-bit sequence number**.
*   **Cumulative ACK**: ACK(n) acknowledges all packets up to and including n.
*   Window advances on ACK(n).
*   **Timer** for oldest in-flight packet.
*   **Timeout(n)**: Retransmits packet n and all higher-sequence packets in the window.

### Receiver Operation

*   Sends **ACK-only** for correctly received, in-order packets (highest in-order sequence number).
*   May generate **duplicate ACKs**.
*   Remembers `rcv_base` (next expected sequence number).
*   **Out-of-order packet**:
    *   **Discard** or **buffer** (implementation choice).
    *   **Re-ACKs** highest in-order sequence number.

### GBN in Action

Example (N=4):

1.  Sender sends 0, 1, 2, 3.
2.  Packet 2 is lost.
3.  Receiver ACKs 0, 1, discards 3, resends ACK 1.
4.  Sender timer for 2 expires.
5.  Sender retransmits 2, 3, 4, 5.
6.  Receiver receives 2, sends ACK 2, delivers buffered packets, and sends subsequent ACKs.

## Selective Repeat (SR)

### Operation

Only retransmits lost packets.

*   Receiver **individually acknowledges** correct packets.
*   Receiver **buffers out-of-order packets**.
*   Sender **times out and retransmits individually**.
*   Sender **timer per unacknowledged packet**.
*   Sender and receiver **windows** of N sequence numbers.

### Sender Window

*   Send if next sequence number is in window.
*   `timeout(n)`: Resend packet n, restart timer.
*   `ACK(n)` (in window): Mark as received. Advance window base if n is smallest unacknowledged.

### Receiver Window

*   Packet n in window: Send `ACK(n)`. Buffer out-of-order. Deliver in-order and advance window.
*   Packet n outside window (but not too far ahead): ACK.
*   Otherwise: Ignore.

### Selective Repeat in Action

Example (N=4):

1.  Sender sends 0, 1, 2, 3.
2.  Packet 2 is lost.
3.  Receiver ACKs 0, 1, buffers 3, sends ACK 3.
4.  Sender times out for 2, retransmits.
5.  Receiver receives 2, delivers 2, 3, 4, 5, sends ACK 2, and so forth.

### Selective Repeat: Dilemma

Window size and sequence number space interaction is critical.

Scenario: Sequence numbers 0, 1, 2, 3; window size 3.  Retransmitted packet 0 can be misinterpreted as a *new* packet 0.

**Solution**: Sequence number space must be larger than twice the window size (2N) to avoid this problem.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

### TCP Overview

**Connection-oriented**, **reliable**, **in-order byte stream** protocol.

*   **Point-to-point**: Single sender, single receiver.
*   **Full duplex**: Bidirectional data flow.
*   **Flow controlled**.
*   **Cumulative ACKs**.
*   **Pipelining**.
*   **Congestion control**.
*    Uses **handshaking** to establish connections.

### TCP Segment Structure

Header and data. Key header fields:

*   **Source/Destination port numbers**.
*   **Sequence number**: Byte stream number of first data byte.
*   **Acknowledgement number**: Next expected byte.  ACK bit indicates validity.
*   **Receive window (rwnd)**: Flow control (receiver buffer space).
*   **Checksum**: Error detection.
*   **Urgent data pointer**.
*    **Options**.
*   **Flags**:
    *   **SYN**: Connection establishment.
    *   **ACK**: Acknowledgement number valid.
    *   **FIN**: Connection termination.
    *   **RST**: Reset connection.
    *   **PSH**: Push.
    *   **URG**: Urgent.
    *   **ECE, CWR**: Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).

### TCP Sequence Numbers and ACKs

*   **Sequence numbers**: **Byte numbers**, not segment numbers.
*   **Acknowledgements**: **Cumulative**.  ACK `y` means all bytes up to (but not including) `y` are received.

Example: Host A sends seq=42, 8 bytes data. Host B ACKs with ack=50.

Receiver handling of out-of-order segments is **implementation-specific** (not dictated by the TCP specification).

### TCP Round Trip Time (RTT) and Timeout

Accurate timeout is crucial:

*   **Too short**: Premature retransmissions, wasted bandwidth.
*   **Too long**: Slow reaction to loss.

TCP estimates RTT using **SampleRTT** (measured time).  **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)** calculates **EstimatedRTT**:

EstimatedRTT = (1 - α) * EstimatedRTT + α * SampleRTT  (α typically 0.125)

**Deviation (DevRTT)**:

DevRTT = (1 - β) * DevRTT + β * |SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|  (β typically 0.25)

**TimeoutInterval**:

TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4 * DevRTT  (4 * DevRTT is a safety margin)

### TCP Sender (Simplified)

*   **Data from application**:
    *   Create segment, set sequence number.
    *   Start timer (if not running).
*   **Timeout**:
    *   Retransmit.
    *   Restart timer.
*   **ACK received**:
    *   Update acknowledged data.
    *   Stop/start timer as needed.

### TCP Receiver: ACK Generation [RFC 5681]

*   **In-order, expected, all prior ACKed**: May use **delayed ACK** (wait up to 500ms).
*   **In-order, expected, pending ACK**: Send **cumulative ACK**.
*   **Out-of-order, gap**: Send **duplicate ACK**.
*   **Fills gap**: Send **ACK** (if segment starts at lower end of gap).

### TCP: Retransmission Scenarios

*   **Lost ACK**: Sender timeouts, retransmits; receiver sends duplicate ACK.
*   **Premature Timeout**: Sender retransmits unnecessarily; receiver handles duplicate.
*   **Cumulative ACK**: Covers for earlier lost ACKs.
*   **TCP Fast Retransmit**: **Three duplicate ACKs** trigger immediate retransmission (don't wait for timeout).

### TCP Flow Control

Prevents sender overwhelming receiver.

*   Receiver has **receive buffers**.
*   **Receive window (rwnd)** in header advertises free buffer space.
*   Sender limits unacknowledged data to <= `rwnd`.
*   `RcvBuffer` size is configurable (often auto-adjusted).

### TCP Connection Management

**Three-way handshake**:

1.  **SYN**: Client sends SYN=1, initial sequence number (x).
2.  **SYNACK**: Server sends SYN=1, ACK=1, sequence number (y), ack=x+1.
3.  **ACK**: Client sends ACK=1, ack=y+1 (may contain data).

Connection established (state: ESTAB).  Variables (sequence numbers, buffers) initialized.

**Closing**: Each side closes independently (FIN bit).  Simultaneous close is possible.

Three-way handshake is necessary to avoid problems with delayed/lost messages (unlike a two-way handshake).

## Principles of Congestion Control

**Congestion**: Too much data, too fast, overwhelms network.

Consequences:

*   **Long delays**: Queuing.
*   **Packet loss**: Buffer overflow.

**Congestion control vs. flow control**:

*   **Congestion control**: Controls data *into* the network (multiple senders).
*   **Flow control**: Controls data to a *specific receiver*.

### Causes and Costs of Congestion

Scenarios:

*   **Infinite Buffers**: Delays increase as arrival rate approaches capacity.
*   **Finite Buffers**: Packet loss, retransmissions (potentially unnecessary), wasted bandwidth.
*   **Multi-hop**: Dropped packets waste upstream resources.

**Costs**:

*   Increased work (retransmissions).
*   Unnecessary retransmissions.
*   Decreased throughput.
*   Increased delays.
*   Wasted upstream resources.

### Approaches

*   **End-end**: No explicit network feedback.  Senders infer congestion (loss/delay).  **TCP** uses this.
*   **Network-assisted**: Routers provide feedback (marking, signaling).  **TCP ECN** is an example.

## TCP Congestion Control

End-end congestion control.

### AIMD (Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease)

*   **Additive Increase**: Increase `cwnd` (congestion window) by 1 MSS per RTT (no loss).  Slow probing.
*   **Multiplicative Decrease**: Reduce `cwnd` upon loss (halve for triple duplicate ACK (Reno), to 1 MSS for timeout (Tahoe)).  Quick reaction.

**"Sawtooth" pattern** of `cwnd`.

### TCP Congestion Control Details

*   Sender limits unacknowledged data: `LastByteSent - LastByteAcked` <= `cwnd`.
*   Rate ≈ `cwnd / RTT`.
*   **Slow Start**: Initial phase. `cwnd` starts at 1 MSS, **doubles every RTT**. Rapid initial growth.
*   **Congestion Avoidance**:  `cwnd` >= `ssthresh` (threshold).  Linear increase (≈ 1 MSS per RTT). `ssthresh` is usually set to half of the `cwnd` when a loss occurs.
*   **Fast Recovery**:  Three duplicate ACKs. Reno: Halve `cwnd`, retransmit, inflate `cwnd` per duplicate ACK.  Exit on new ACK. Tahoe: `cwnd` = 1 MSS, enter slow start.

### TCP CUBIC

Modern algorithm.  Uses cubic function for window adjustment.

*   Time-based (since last congestion).
*   Less RTT-dependent.
*   Better for high-bandwidth, long-delay networks.
*   Faster initial ramp-up, cautious approach to `Wmax` (pre-loss window).
*    `K` represents the point in time when the TCP window size will hit W_max. The growth of cwnd is determined by a function of the cube of the time elapsed since K.

Default in Linux.

### TCP and the Congested "Bottleneck Link"

**Bottleneck link**:  Usually busy, queue buildup, packet loss.  TCP aims to keep the "pipe" full without overflowing the bottleneck.  Increasing rate beyond bottleneck capacity doesn't improve throughput, increases RTT.

### Delay-based TCP Congestion Control

Uses network delay (RTT increases) as congestion signal (before loss).  Maximize throughput, minimize delay.  Examples: BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT).

### Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)

**Network-assisted**.  Routers mark IP header (ToS) to indicate congestion.  Destination sets ECE bit in TCP ACK.  Sender reacts *before* loss.

### TCP Fairness

Ideally, K TCP sessions sharing bottleneck link R should each get R/K.

TCP's AIMD is generally fair (under ideal conditions).

Real-world factors affect fairness: Different RTTs, UDP traffic, multiple connections.

## Evolving Transport-Layer Functionality
Shifting some transport functions to the application layer (often over UDP).

### HTTP/3: QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)

Application-layer protocol over UDP (by Google).

*   **Reliable data transfer**, **security (TLS)**, **congestion control** at application layer.
*   **Multiple streams** over one QUIC connection (overcomes head-of-line blocking of HTTP/2 over TCP).
*   **Faster connection establishment** (often 1 RTT).
*   Congestion control/loss detection similar to TCP.

Addresses challenges: Long, fat pipes, wireless loss, long-delay links, data center latency.

## Summary
