## Introduction to Unix

**UNIX**, developed at **AT&T Bell Labs in the 1970s (Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, et al.)**, is a multi-user, multi-tasking OS.  It significantly influenced modern OSs (Linux, macOS).

## Design Philosophy of Unix

*   **Modularity**: Small, focused programs combined for complex tasks.
*   **Simplicity**: Clear and concise design.
*   **Portability**: Runs on various hardware.
*   **"Everything is a file"**: Unified interaction with system resources.

## Unix File System

*   **Hierarchical structure**: Root directory (/) and subdirectories (tree-like).
*   **File permissions**: Read (r), write (w), execute (x).
*   **Ownership**: User and group.
*   **Inodes**: Data structures storing file metadata (not content).

## Unix Process Management

*   **Background processes**: Run without user interaction.
*   **Foreground processes**: Run with user interaction (terminal).
*   **Process IDs (PIDs)**: Unique identifiers.
*   Commands: `ps` (process status), `kill` (terminate), `nice` (priority).

## Unix Security

*   **Root privileges**: Superuser account (unrestricted access).
*   **User authentication**: Passwords, SSH keys.
*   **File permissions**: Restricting access.
*   **Principle of least privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions.

## Unix Variants

*   **BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)**: Includes **FreeBSD** (popular in servers and firewalls, embedded systems), **OpenBSD** (security-focused), and **NetBSD** (wide platform availability, embedded systems).
    *   **4.xBSD**: Used in academia, basis for many commercial UNIX products.
    *   **4.4BSD**: Final Berkeley release.
*   **Solaris**: Developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle).  **Solaris 11** is based on Oracle's SVR4 release with features like preemptable, multithreaded kernel, SMP, and object-oriented file system interface.
*   **AIX**: Developed by IBM.

## Pros & Cons of Unix

*   **Pros**:
    *   Stability.
    *   Security.
    *   Flexibility.
    *   Powerful command-line tools.
    *   Portability.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Steep learning curve (command-line).
    *   Less user-friendly GUI.
    *   Hardware compatibility can vary.
