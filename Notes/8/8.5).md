## Introduction to Android OS

**Android** is a **Linux-based mobile OS developed by Google**.  Dominant mobile OS globally.  Open-source, customizable, designed for touchscreens.  Originally by Android Inc. (bought by Google in 2005).  First version (1.0) in 2008. Most recent is Android 16.0. Active developer community uses **Android Open Source Project (AOSP)**.

## Android Architecture

*   **Kernel**: Linux kernel.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**: Interface between hardware and software.
*   **Android Runtime (ART)**: Executes Android applications (earlier versions used Dalvik).
*   **Framework**: APIs for application development.

## Android App Development

*   Programming languages: Java and Kotlin.
*   **Android Studio**: Official IDE.
*   **Android Software Development Kit (SDK)**: Libraries, tools, documentation.

## Android Security Features

*   **Google Play Protect**: Malware scanning.
*   **App sandboxing**: Isolated app environments.
*   **Encryption**: Data encryption.
*   **Permissions**: User consent for app access.

## Android Runtime (Dalvik & ART)

*   **Dalvik**: Used in earlier Android releases. Limitations: scaling to larger memories, multi-core. Each app ran in its own Dalvik VM instance. Bytecode transformed to native instructions.
*   **Android Runtime (ART)**: Current standard. Fully compatible with Dalvik's bytecode.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of ART

*  **Advantages**:
    *   Reduced app startup time (native code execution).
    *   Improved battery life (no JIT compilation).
    *   Lesser RAM footprint (no JIT cache).
    *   Garbage Collection and debug enhancements.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   Longer app installation time (bytecode conversion at install).
    *   First boot/factory reset takes longer (dex2opt compilation).
    *   Native code requires more storage space.

## Pros & Cons of Android

*   **Pros**:
    *   Wide range of devices.
    *   Open-source.
    *   Highly customizable.
    *   Large app ecosystem.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Fragmentation (inconsistent versions/features).
    *   Potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Bloatware from manufacturers.
