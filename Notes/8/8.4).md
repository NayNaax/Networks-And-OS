## Introduction to Linux

**Linux** is an **open-source, Unix-like OS**, developed by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**.  The core is the **Linux kernel**.  Known for flexibility, security, and community-driven development.

## Linux Kernel & Distributions

*   **Linux kernel**: Core of the OS; manages hardware.
*   **Distributions (Distros)**: Complete OS packages built around the kernel (software, utilities, desktop environments).
*   Examples: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch Linux.

## Linux File System

*   **ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem)**: Widely used, robust, journaling (prevents data corruption). Offers mature and high data integrity, good large file support.
*   **XFS**: High performance and scalability (large files/volumes), parallel I/O.  Excellent with large files, but can be more complex to manage, may have poor performance with small files.
*   **Btrfs**: Snapshotting, dynamic inode allocation, device management, transparent compression. Advanced error detection, flexible volume management, but younger with less widespread support.
*    **ZFS on Linux**: Originally for Solaris, high storage capacities, integrated volume management, robust data integrity verification. Requires more memory for optimal performance.
*   **exFAT & ntfs-fuse**: Support for Windows file systems (read/write on Windows partitions). exFAT optimized for flash, ntfs-fuse manages NTFS via user-space, but performance varies, potential compatibility issues.

## Linux User Interface

*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Terminal (text-based).
*   **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE).
*   Essential commands: `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `chmod`.

## Linux Process Management

Commands: `ps` (process status), `top` (real-time monitoring), `kill`, `nice`.

## Linux Security Features

*   **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**: Mandatory access control.
*   **iptables/firewalld**: Firewall management.
*   **sudo privileges**: Controlled root access.
*   Standard user permissions and file ownership (Unix-based).

## Real-World Uses of Linux

*   **Servers**: Dominates server environments (stability, security, performance, open-source, cost-effective).  Examples: web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
*   **Embedded systems**: Routers, smart devices.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Smart home devices, industrial automation.
*   **Cloud computing**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud rely heavily on Linux.
*   **Supercomputing**: Dominant OS for high-performance computing.

## Pros & Cons of Linux

*   **Pros**:
    *   Open-source (free, publicly available code).
    *   Highly customizable.
    *   Secure.
    *   Stable.
    *   Vast software repository.
    *   Strong community support.
*   **Cons**:
    *   Steeper learning curve (command-line).
    *   Hardware compatibility issues (less common now).
    *   Some proprietary software limitations.
