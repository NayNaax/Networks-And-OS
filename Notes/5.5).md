# Hierarchical Addressing

*   IP addressing is hierarchical, which is crucial for efficient routing on the Internet.
*   Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are allocated large blocks of addresses.
*   ISPs then allocate smaller blocks (subnets) to their customers.
*   This allows routers to advertise routes for entire blocks, rather than individual addresses or small networks, significantly reducing the size and complexity of routing tables.
* if an organization moves from one ISP to another, there is no need to renumber all hosts.

# Address Acquisition

*   **Hosts:**
    *   **Static Configuration:**  An administrator manually configures the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server.
    *   **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** The host automatically obtains an IP address and other configuration information from a DHCP server.
*   **Networks:** A network (e.g., a company or a home network) gets a block of addresses from its ISP.
*   **ISPs:** ISPs obtain blocks of addresses from Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), which are allocated addresses by ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

# IPv4 Address Exhaustion

*   The pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses was officially exhausted in 2011 (when ICANN allocated the last blocks to the RIRs).
*   **NAT (Network Address Translation)** has helped to extend the lifespan of IPv4 by allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.
*   **IPv6**, with its vastly larger address space (128-bit addresses), is the long-term solution to address exhaustion.
