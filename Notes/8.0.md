# Introduction to Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System (OS)?

An **Operating System (OS)** is software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and applications.

## Functions of an OS

*   **Process Management**: Scheduling and execution of processes (programs in running state).
*   **Memory Management**: Allocating and deallocating memory to programs.
*   **File System Management**: Managing data storage and retrieval (files and directories).
*   **Device Management**: Controlling hardware components (printers, keyboards, displays) via device drivers.
*   **User Interface**: Providing a way for users to interact with the computer (GUI or CLI).
