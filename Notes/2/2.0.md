# Network Fundamentals: A Concise Overview

## Network Layering (TCP/IP Model)

-   **Concept**: Breaks down communication into layers, each with a specific function.
-   **Layers**:
    -   **Application**: User-facing (encoding, protocols like HTTP).
    -   **Transport**: Packet creation, reliability (TCP/UDP).
    -   **Network**: Addressing (source/destination).
    -   **Link**: Physical transmission.
-   **Benefits**: Standardization, adaptability, flexibility.

## Application Layer

-   **Network Applications**: Programs communicating across a network.
-   **Client-Server**: Server (always-on, fixed IP) waits, client initiates.
-   **P2P**: Peers communicate directly, self-scaling, but complex management.
-   **Processes**: Running programs communicate via messages.
-   **Sockets**: Interface for processes to send/receive messages.
-   **Addressing**: IP Address (host) + Port Number (process).
-   **Application-Layer Protocols**: Define communication rules (message types, syntax, semantics).

## Transport Layer

-   **Application Requirements**: Varying needs (reliability, timing, throughput, security).
-   **TCP**: Reliable, connection-oriented, flow/congestion control.
-   **UDP**: Unreliable, connectionless, faster (for latency-sensitive apps).

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

-   Web's application layer protocol.  Client (browser) requests, server responds.
-   Uses TCP.
-   **Stateless**: Server doesn't remember past requests.
-   **Connections**:
    -   **Non-persistent**: One connection per object (slow).
    -   **Persistent (HTTP/1.1)**: Multiple objects per connection (faster).
-   **Messages**: Request (methods like GET, POST) and Response (status codes like 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
-   **Cookies**: Maintain state (since HTTP is stateless).
-   **Web Caches**: Store content closer to users (reduce latency, traffic).
-   **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Improvements for speed and efficiency, addressing limitations.

## E-mail (SMTP, IMAP)

-   **Components**: User agents, mail servers, SMTP.
-   **SMTP**: Protocol for *sending* email *between mail servers*. Uses TCP. Command/response interaction.
-   **Mail Access Protocols**: For *retrieving* email (IMAP - keeps mail on server).

## DNS (Domain Name System)

-   **Purpose**: Maps domain names (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses.
-   **Distributed, Hierarchical Database**: Avoids a single point of failure/bottleneck.
-   **Server Types**: Root, TLD, Authoritative, Local.
-   **Query Types**: Iterated (server refers to another), Recursive (server handles full resolution).
-   **Caching**: Improves speed, reduces load.
-   **Records**: `(name, value, type, ttl)` (e.g., A records for IP addresses).
-   **Security**: DNSSEC provides security.

## P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Applications

-   Peers communicate directly, no central server.
-   **Self-Scaling**: Capacity grows with users.
-   **BitTorrent**: Example file-sharing protocol. Chunks, tracker, tit-for-tat.

## Video Streaming and CDNs

-   **Challenges**: Scale, heterogeneity, varying bandwidth, loss/delay.
-   **Video Basics**: Frames, pixels, compression (spatial, temporal).
-   **DASH**: Adaptive streaming. Client chooses quality based on bandwidth.
-   **CDNs**: Distribute content geographically to improve performance.
    -   **Enter Deep**: Many servers close to users.
    -   **Bring Home**: Fewer, larger clusters.
-  **OTT (Over the top)**: services that deliver content over the internet.

## Socket Programming

-   **Socket**: Interface between application and transport protocol.
-   **UDP**: Connectionless, unreliable.  Explicit addressing required.
-   **TCP**: Connection-oriented, reliable.  Server "listens" and "accepts" connections.  Client "connects".

## Important Themes

-   Centralized vs. Decentralized.
-   Stateless vs. Stateful.
-   Scalability.
-   Reliable vs. Unreliable transfer.
-   Complexity at the network edge.
